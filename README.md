<h1>S.M.A.R.T-Siksha</h1>
<h3>Project details:</h3>
<p>In this project we are aiming to develop an open platform where we could recognize  the klutz so that remedial instructions can be given and novel techniques can be developed. There are a lot of things that slow learners struggle with, like low self-confidence, not setting goals, not being able to think of solutions to problems, not being good at memorizing. This website allows us to get in touch with people who face such issues with our different technical approaches. Through this website we can analyze their assessment data and IQ levels and create new strategies to help them succeed in different realms of life. To sum up this website In conclusion, this website will give the learners all the necessary information links and quizzes and evaluations in one place so they donâ€™t have to roam around.In addition, we will strive to create an environment of competition for the benefit of students. " A slow learner is not defined by their limitations but by their limitless determination to overcome them. </p>
